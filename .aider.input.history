+Code the following app
+```
+Idea: A portfolio rebalancing calculator.
+User Goal: Keep portfolio aligned with target percentages (e.g., 50% BTC, 25% ETH, 25% SOL) without doing math manually.
+Core Features (MVP):
+
+* Input: Current holdings (qty), Current Prices, Target Allocation %.
+* Calculation: The specific trades to make (e.g., "Sell 0.1 BTC, Buy 5 SOL").
+* "Smart Rebalance": Suggest using stablecoins to balance instead of selling assets if possible.
+
+Development Plan:
+
+1. Create a state management system for the user's portfolio input.
+2. Fetch live prices to calculate current total value.
+3. Implement the rebalancing algorithm (Target Value - Current Value).
+4. Display a clean "Action List" (Buy X / Sell Y).
+5. No API keys needed (privacy focused)—user enters balances manually.
+```
+
+Generate an app logo and update the app metadata title and description.
